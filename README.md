# Foundations of AI and Machine Learning

This short course introduces foundational concepts and implementation of supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) approaches, tailored for public health practitioners and students with intermediate R programming skills. The course will be structured to cover supervised learning in the first half and unsupervised learning in the second half.

# Course Description

This short course introduces foundational concepts and implementation of supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) approaches, tailored for public health practitioners and students with intermediate R programming skills. The synchronous sessions will focus on fundamental principles, best practices, and examples. The two accompanying coding assignments will be distributed as R Markdown files with tasks and suggested data to use to provide an opportunity for practice hands-on implementation of popular models. The course will be structured to cover supervised learning in the first half and unsupervised learning in the second half. An introduction to large language models (LLMs) will also be included. 

# Pre-requisites

Learners with an interest in diving deeper into the mechanics of supervised and unsupervised learning with hands-on coding examples. Intermediate R skill-level required (can write basic scripts and navigate documentation to implement new packages)

# Learning Objectives

During the course, learners will gain an understanding of

1. Fundamental principles of supervised learning and when and how to use linear models. 
2. The motivation behind boosting and how to implement commonly-used boosting models in R. 
3. The importance of supervised learning evaluation and how to interpret different metrics in the context of a given model set up. 
4. Fundamental principles of unsupervised learning including use cases for clustering and topic models. 
5. How to implement common clustering techniques and topic models and interpret the outputs of these two different approaches. 
6. Improved machine learning related coding and data skills.
